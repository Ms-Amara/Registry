# Why am I getting a manifest version error when I try to tag my image?
{: #troubleshoot-manifest-error-version}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

You get a manifest version error when you try to tag your image in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}}: `The manifest version for this image is not supported for tagging.`
{: shortdesc}

You tried to tag your image, but you receive the following error message: `The manifest version for this image is not supported for tagging. To upgrade to a supported manifest version, pull and push this image by using Docker version 1.12 or later, then run the 'ibmcloud cr image-tag' command again.`
{: tsSymptoms}

The manifest version is not supported.
{: tsCauses}

To resolve the problem, complete the following steps:
{: tsResolve}

1. Upgrade to Docker Engine version 1.12 or later.

2. Pull the image that you tried to tag by running the following command, where `<source_image>` is your source image name:

   ```
   docker pull <source_image>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. To upgrade the manifest version, push the image by running the following command:

   ```
   docker push <source_image>
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Tag the image by running the `ibmcloud cr image-tag` command, see [Creating new images that refer to a source image](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_images_#registry_images_source).
